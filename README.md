- In the current system, the municipal body provides the addresses, and the postal service only delivers to that particular location. There is no centralisation and it relies heavily on the postman knowing where each locality is.

- Digital Access Code would provide a way to locate each and every address with just an alphanumeric code.

- It would provide us with a better solution to eCommerce frauds as no one can put fake addresses as we would verify before entering address by sending OTP.

- As soon as DAC would be implemented and integrated with various databases it would improve efficiency as there is standardization.

## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Digital Access Code generation and use for Address tracking

- Description: Assignment of Digital Address Code (DAC) comprising geo-coordinates of the house (Latitude/Longitude) will ease the process of locating addresses for delivery of government services and other purposes. Digital Address could be defined as a unique, standard and permanent identification of a physical address on a digital map having some sense of directionality and intuitiveness. The address needs to be differentiated from the addressee. DAC will also allow authentication of address and elimination of fake addresses and aims to create a central database of addresses. The Hackathon team should design and implement most efficient design, creation and use of the DAC for purposes mentioned above Teams need to take care of speed, accuracy, storage complexity, security, flexibility of the DAC, Exclusion of sensitive locations etc.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

- We aim to remove long addresses with names and replace them with simple alphanumeric characters by usage of DAC

- Also, we plan to create an API that would be used for address authentication for various services

- To prevent the leaking of sensitive addresses special DAC would be created to not allow hackers to know whom it belongs to.

- Sensitive addresses are protected

- Also, data regarding owners of DACs will be encrypted to prevent any misuse of data.

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.
